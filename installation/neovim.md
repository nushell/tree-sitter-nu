The ability to add syntax highlighting can be provided by [tree-sitter] using
[nvim-treesitter]  (please refer to its own installation instructions).

```lua
local parser_config = require("nvim-treesitter.parsers").get_parser_configs()

parser_config.nu = {
  install_info = {
    url = "https://github.com/nushell/tree-sitter-nu",
    files = { "src/parser.c" },
    branch = "main",
  },
  filetype = "nu",
}
```

Run `:TSInstall nu` in neovim to install the above parser.

With [tree-sitter] available, you can now add [highlights queries] to associate
highlight groups with tree-sitter nodes. Run `:highlight` in neovim for a list
of highlight groups.

If you are using the `lazy` package manager for *neovim*, you can run the
following snippet to install the hightlights file and enable the highlighting:
```nushell
let remote = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nushell/tree-sitter-nu/main/queries/"
let local = (
    $env.XDG_DATA_HOME?
    | default ($env.HOME | path join ".local" "share")
    | path join "nvim" "lazy" "nvim-treesitter" "queries" "nu"
)

let file = "highlights.scm"

mkdir $local

[
  highlights.scm
  locals.scm
  folds.scm
  injections.scm
] | each {|query|
  http get ([$remote $query] | str join "/") | save ($local | path join $query)
}
```
